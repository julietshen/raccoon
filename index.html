			<p>Raccoons are smaller relatives of bears. They are native to South and North America, but they can be found in Asia and Europe also. Raccoons live in wooded areas close to water, but they can be often found near urban areas. There are 7 different species of raccoons. Pygmy raccoon is the only endangered species.

			<p>They have grayish fur, black mask around eyes and long tail covered with black and brown bands. Because of their tail, they are nicknamed "ringtail". Raccoon's hand looks like human's. They have five fingers and use their hands to collect food, open shells, door or trash cans.</p>

			<p>Raccoons often place food in water before they start to eat it. They have highly sensitive sense of touch and water increases sensitivity even more. By touching the food they get better insight about things they will eat. They are excellent swimmers and climbers.</p>

			<p>Zoologist Clinton Hart Merriam described raccoons as "clever beasts", and that "in certain directions their cunning surpasses that of the fox." The animal's intelligence gave rise to the epithet "sly coon". Only a few studies have been undertaken to determine the mental abilities of raccoons, most of them based on the animal's sense of touch. In a study by the ethologist H. B. Davis in 1908, raccoons were able to open 11 of 13 complex locks in fewer than 10 tries and had no problems repeating the action when the locks were rearranged or turned upside down. Davis concluded they understood the abstract principles of the locking mechanisms and their learning speed was equivalent to that of rhesus macaques. Studies in 1963, 1973, 1975 and 1992 concentrated on raccoon memory showed they can remember the solutions to tasks for up to three years. In a study by B. Pohl in 1992, raccoons were able to instantly differentiate between identical and different symbols three years after the short initial learning phase. Stanislas Dehaene reports in his book The Number Sense raccoons can distinguish boxes containing two or four grapes from those containing three.</p>
