<p>Raccoons are smaller relatives of bears. They are native to South and North America, but they can be found in Asia and Europe also. Raccoons live in wooded areas close to water, but they can be often found near urban areas. There are 7 different species of raccoons. Pygmy raccoon is the only endangered species.

<p>They have grayish fur, black mask around eyes and long tail covered with black and brown bands. Because of their tail, they are nicknamed "ringtail". Raccoon's hand looks like human's. They have five fingers and use their hands to collect food, open shells, door or trash cans.</p>

<p>Raccoons often place food in water before they start to eat it. They have highly sensitive sense of touch and water increases sensitivity even more. By touching the food they get better insight about things they will eat. They are excellent swimmers and climbers.</p>
